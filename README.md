# Breast-Cancer-Prediction

This project focuses on predicting breast cancer using various machine learning algorithms. The dataset, sourced from sklearn.datasets, was initially in dictionary format and was converted into a DataFrame for easier manipulation and analysis. The features and target were separated, and the data was split into training and testing sets.

The project employs a range of machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gradient Boosting, Decision Tree, and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The performance of these models was evaluated by comparing their accuracies, which were visualized in a graph to identify the most effective algorithm for breast cancer prediction. This analysis provides insights into the strengths and weaknesses of different models in classifying breast cancer data.
